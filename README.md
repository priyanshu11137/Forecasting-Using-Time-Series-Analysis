# GDP Per Capita Prediction

This project was conducted by a group of three individuals, Priyanshu, Swastik, and Havi Bohra, as part of the Public Policy and Opinion Cell at IIT Kanpur. The main focus of the project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of different development indicators and their significance in assessing a country's development.

## Project Description

### First Submission

In the first submission, we selected a UN-approved development indicator and prepared a report on it. The report includes the following sections:

1. Standard Definition: We defined the selected development indicator.
2. Methodologies for Estimation/Surveying: We explored different approaches and methodologies used for estimating or surveying the selected development indicator.
3. Responsible Agencies/Organizations: We identified the agencies or organizations responsible for calculating these indices or rankings.
4. Indicator History and Significance: We researched the historical background of the indicator and its significance in various aspects of a country's development, such as the economic and social spheres.
5. Criticisms and Limitations: We discussed possible criticisms and limitations associated with the indicator.
6. Improvement and Alternatives: We proposed potential solutions for improving the estimation/calculation process of the indicator or alternative methods for calculating the same indicator.

### Second Submission

In the second submission, we selected a development indicator approved internationally by the UN. We then identified at least three major factors affecting the indicator and trained at least two different machine learning models to estimate the indicator value. The final submission includes the following components:

1. Code: The code for the project implemented as a Google Colab notebook or shared as a link. We ensured the originality of the code and avoided plagiarism.
2. Summary Report: We prepared a concise summary report describing the process and approach used for implementing the models. This report includes details about the dataset used, plots generated, accuracy/R2 scores for all the types of models implemented, and step-by-step instructions on how to run the notebook.
